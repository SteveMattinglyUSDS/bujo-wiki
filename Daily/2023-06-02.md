## schema versioning

- should be scala, so can be used front and/or backend
- maybe like tax year it is a writable fact in the dictionary; would persist
- use 1 for first value
- on load, compare versions, with 0 as default; if mismatch:
    - for input of version n, run functions n...current, where each migrates up one version
