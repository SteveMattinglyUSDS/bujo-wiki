## facts needed for people-you-support

I've been working on a gap analysis between the fact dictionary and the "People you support" flow, based on the Mural board with that title.

I will try to turn all this into suggested changes for the dictionary, but first I thought I would invite input on the following. I'm uncertain about some possible between the two sides, and it also looks like some flow details may not be settled. 

## Missing

I think we need to add dictionary facts for:
- is the person capable of self care
- is the person filing a return only to claim a refund

## Residency

- Dictionary: there's a Boolean `residencyTest` for (potential) dependents described as "Did the dependent live with you for more than half the year?"
- Mural: there are logic branches for "all year", "6-11 months", and "less than 6 months", but associated screen designs have stickies with questions about handling this. Some places also ask about living together *in the U.S.* specifically. 

## Custodial parent

- Dictionary: there is nothing for this
- Mural: there are designs that ask if taxpayer is the dependent's custodial parent, but these have stickies with questions that overlap with Residency above.

## Cost of keeping up (some) home

- Dictionary: there's a `costOfKeepingUpHome` Boolean fact but it does not apply to dependents or even to filers-- it seems to be asking about the primary filer or "taxpayer"
- Mural: the question is asked for each person in question, and distinguishes *parent's* home as a (semi-?)separate fact.
