- [ ] check relationship mural dropdown against enum


## dependents facts

here "legal parent" = biological or adopted, but there is an open question whether the term includes others, too

note: review these and 
- [ ] add missing flow control facts
- [ ] rename per AddPersonX names

### Name, Age, Relationship

- firstName
- middleInitial
- lastName
- suffix
    - [ ] not used in mural design
- dateOfBirth
- relationship
    - [ ] check mural dropdown against enum options

### Student, Disability, Self-care

- [ ] flowAgeGreaterThanNineteenAtYearEnd
    - mural says "ask" this, but assume we compute it
- fullTimeStudent
- permanentTotalDisability
- [ ] flowAgeGreaterThanThirteenAtTaxYearStart
    - mural says "ask" this, but assume we compute it
- [ ] capableOfSelfCare

### Residency Duration

- residencyTest
    - [ ] modify this Boolean to enum: { All year, 6-11 mo, less than 6 mo}
    - [ ] memberOfHouseholdTest maybe can be eliminated, but check flow

### Special Rule Benefit Split

- ageTest
- [ ] flowMajorityShortcut
    - if person 21 yo by 7/2, can skip entire benefit split issue (age of majority everywhere)

    - [ ] this needs to incorporate spouseIsLegalParent, below
- [ ] flowAddPersonMFJOtherTPRelationship

- [ ] flowAddPersonAnotherParentInPicture
    - bio child, adopted child, or (per Jen, not in mural)spouseIsLegalParent
- [ ] hasOtherLegalParent
