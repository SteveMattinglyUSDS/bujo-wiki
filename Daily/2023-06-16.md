- while working on dictionary vs. persister type mismatches, found tangent issue:
    - there exists type mismatches internal to persisted data
        - these probably never result from schema changes, only adversarial data?
        - these prevent creation of persister; upickle throws
        - API currently gives generic 503 for these, which sucks
        - started looking to handle better
            - want `FactGraphService.f(jsonRequestFacts)` that detects these
                - call from TaxReturnService create, update, submit 
            - FactGraphService has `setFacts(Map<String, Object>)` which seems to be used only by tests
                - snag: `jsonRequestFacts` is incompatible `Map<String, FactTypeWithItem>` 
                - options
                    - convert `setFacts` and tests! to use `FactTypeWithItem`
                    -
