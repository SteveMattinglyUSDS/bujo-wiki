- [ ] check relationship mural dropdown against enum


## dependents facts

here "legal parent" = biological or adopted, but there is an open question whether the term includes others, too

### Name, Age, Relationship

- firstName
- middleInitial
- lastName
- suffix
    - [ ] not used in mural design
- dateOfBirth
- relationship
    - [ ] mural enumerates different values than those for the existing enum used elsewhere; need two enums? 

### Student, Disability, Self-care

- [ ] flowAddPersonStudent
    - mural says "ask" if person is > 19 at EOY, but I assume we will compute it
- fullTimeStudent
- permanentTotalDisability
- [ ] flowAddPersonDisabilitySelfCare
    - mural says "ask" if person is > 13 at start of Ty, but I assume we will compute it
- [ ] capableOfSelfCare

### Residency Duration

- residencyTest
    - [ ] modify this Boolean to enum: { All year, 6-11 mo, less than 6 mo}
    - [ ] existing memberOfHouseholdTest can be eliminated (equivalent to All year above)

### Special Rule Benefit Split

- ageTest
- [ ] flowAgeOnJulySecond
    - if person is 21 yo by 7/2, skip entire benefit split issue because they are age of majority everywhere
    - also used below to test if person subject to custody
- relationshipTest
    - [ ] this will need to be modified IF enum for relationship is modified
    - [ ] this should also be true when relationship holds with respect to taxpayer's *spouse*
- [ ] flowAddPersonMFJOtherTPRelationship
    - stepchild or unrelated and tp is MFJ
- [ ] tpSpouseIsLegalParent
- [ ] flowAddPersonAnotherParentInPicture
    - bio child, adopted child, or (per Jen, not in mural)tpSpouseIsLegalParent
- [ ] hasOtherLegalParent
- [ ] otherLegalParentNotClaiming Y/N/IDK
- [ ] tpOrSpouseNotClaiming Y/N only
- screens for the next two items can use flowAgeOnJulySecond for flow control: > 17 and < 21 maybe subject to custody
- [ ] reachedAgeOfMajority
- [ ] grantedMajorityStatus
- [ ] legalParentsLiving
- [ ] livedWithTpOrOtherLegalParentMoreThanSixMonths
- [ ] nightsWithTpVsOther: more with me, fewer, same
- [ ] tpAgiHigherThanOtherParent
- [ ] tpIsCustodialParent (derived)
- [ ] tpStatusWithOtherLegalParent: div/sep, lived apart last 6 months of year, none of the above
- supportTest 
- [ ] elibibleForBenefitSplit (derived)

### Person's home for the year

- [ ] eligibleEitc (derived, but how? is this tp instead of dep?)
- [ ] livedWithTpInUSMostOfYear
- [ ] tpPaidMostOfHomeUpkeep
    - flow logic for this and the following are ... complex
- [ ] tpPaidMostOfParentHomeUpkeep

NEXT: was trying to check that existing facts are used, but some meanings are unclear; suggestion: go breadth first and work thru mural, because some of the concepts appear later in it and may become clear 

### TIN test

- [ ] tinType { SSN, ITIN, ATIN, None }
- tin
- ssnValidForEmployment
    - [ ] change type from Boolean to enum below
    - [ ] drop `filer` from enum named filerSSnEmploymentValidity

### Support tests

#### qc support test

- ownSupport

#### qr support test

- supportTest 
    - [ ] description would need reworded-- ok?
- grossIncomeTest

### Marital status + joint return test

- married
- jointReturn
- [ ] filingOnlyForRefund

### Citizenship, residency

skipped for now

### Qualifying child of another

- qualifyingChildOfAnother
- [ ] potentialClaimerMustFile
- [ ] potentialClaimerDidFile
- [ ] potentialClaimerFiledOnlyForRefund

### Determination + choice

- tpClaims: { yes, no, decide later }
