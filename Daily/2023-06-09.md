- [/] confirm behavior of [dictionary change scenarios](./2023-06-02.md), ideally as test code
    - need to manipulate dictionary on the fly
        - when `FactGraphService` created without autoload of xml, it has "empty" dictionary (Scala class) and digest (filename, enumMap, factMap)
        - test should
            1. create its own local FGS
            2. fgs.getDictionary().
- [ ] assess "check paths" approach
