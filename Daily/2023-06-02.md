## schema checking 

- should be scala, so can be used front and/or backend
- ~~maybe like tax year it is a writable fact in the dictionary; would persist~~ no: tests use simple dictionaries with no assumptions

### general approaches

- numeric versioning of entire schema
- numeric versioning of individual nodes; would have to work if properties are not present
- logic based; series of `if persister content x is in state y perform conversion z`
    - may be too expensive, as checks would repeat and always run
    - OTOH, numeric versioning does not eliminate unneeded checks (just avoids repeat) because old schema may not contain the issue (because of partial data entry, etc.)
    - is there a compromise? blindly do check, but store fact that it's done
- what are limitations of: just check that each persister path is in dictionary (maybe drop those that aren't?) and compare $types, writeableness

### self-documenting schema changes?

- add properties to dictionary nodes: `sinceSchema`, `untilSchema`; defaults are 0 and infinity, respectively
- on reading old version n, find all nodes with either value > n; apply them in numeric order

### inventory of dictionary change scenarios

latest hypothesis: `checkFactTypes` can be expanded to check schema; it reports findings for user of fact graph to process/migrate
- insert fact: no problem
- delete fact: getting non-existent path errors "attempted to retrieve value of an incomplete result"
  - [x] `checkFactTypes` removes fact from persister and reports this
- modify fact:
  - comp node "formula": no problem; will recalc
  - node data type: this bit us
    - [x] `checkFactTypes` reports this
  - enum value removed: seems problematic; limit handle this?
  - enum value added: no problem; user would need to modify data if they wanted it
  - enum value changed: disallowed?
  - writeable becomes derived: would need to remove it from persister?
  - derived becomes writable: would have to have entry from user/wouldn't be persisted
  - fact moves (path changes): 
    - writeable: either user must re-enter, or we can convert
    - derived: it will calc; old path would not be persisted
